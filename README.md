2025 Master's Dissertation
Included here are the following:
1) Main Do-File, which essentially includes everything from cleaning to heterogeneity, to robustness. I did my best to explain the work with extensive commenting. 
2) Stata-Outputs Zip File: Folders with Descriptives (1) for movers and non-movers, Descriptives (2) including late-movers, Pcon Comparisons, and Regression Outputs from all the analyses.
3) Misc: includes map data & shapefile, and initial cleaning done to the inequality data, which mainly corrects individual pcon spelling
